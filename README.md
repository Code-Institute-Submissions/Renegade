# WELCOME TO RENEGADE BAND PAGE 


[View the live project here.](https://renegade-band.herokuapp.com/)


This project was built for Code Institute's Portfolio 5 Assessment.  
It was built via Full-stack development program through Django Framework.  
More on Technologies used can be found below.

Site is a fictitious e-commerce band page for American Metal Band called **Renegade**.  
It allows users to access band's **merch** & **tour events** but also offers information on band members, about section and band songs, especially **new songs** *(singles)* which can be found on home page.

Project Idea came from my own interest to build a site a friend who actively plays in a band. It is a good opportunity to showcase the skills learned over the course.

### Agile Approach
Site functionality and development all through this project was managed using GitHub Projects which can be found here [Renegade Band User Stories](https://github.com/users/anluke/projects/4).

<br>

### The Scope

#### Main Site Goals

- To provide users with a good website experience with Band Merch & Tour Events.
- To provide users with a visually pleasing website that is intuitive and easy to navigate.
- To provide a website with a clear purpose.
- To provide tools that allow users to search for products.
- To provide users with an easy and safe way to buy their products.
- To provide users with breadcrumbs menu so they can more easily navigate through the site.

<br>

#### Colours

![Colours](./README_Images/Colors/Colors%20charts.png)<br>

- Color Scheme is simple but still modern. As I'm a fan of **"Dark Mode on everything"**, I decided to go with Black background with white text. Hero Image touches on **Orange** and **Yellow** color with darker tones. **Cancel** button is in **warning-red** color while **Tour** buttons are all blue. Most of the continuity buttons are colored in **warning-color** as that gives a clear distinction of a button navigation to next step. Warning/Danger colors have nothing to with names, I just used them directly from bootstrap as they represented the best option for me.  
Checkout button inside the **toast** checkout popup is also labeled light blue.  
**EDIT** button is left white, **DELETE** is red and ***Update** is light blue.  
Black color was used for both header and footer with white text.




#### Typography

- Roboto font is used as the main font for the whole project.

#### Imagery

- Most of the images are **.PNG** and **.JPEG** format.  
Future improvement could be made by transforming them all into **.WEBP** file to improve the site performance but due to the length of this project I realised that a bit too late and left it as a future minor improvement.

## VIDEOS

![VIDEOS](./README_Images/Page%20Images/videos/desktop_videos.png)
- Video section has all of the bands official video songs or songs that have a video format.  
- Links are hosted via **YouTube** and imported to page directly by using **EMBED** link in the **URL** of the form.  
An example of a suck URL is: ***https://www.youtube.com/embed/0zMMAQVWeag***  
that ```/embed/``` in between **YT** page and **ID** of the song is very important for proper rendering.  
- If you do not put embed into the link, DJANGO will render the whole YouTube page you are seeing, including the music video.  
I have found this way to be best to utilize what I want and have also put a warning in the form.

<br>
<br>

***For Videos I have used Alter Bridge video songs as links.***  
***Needless to say, not just because I'm the fan but because I took inspiration from their website.***  

<br>

With videos you can only **EDIT** or **DELETE**.  
Since music is being played directly from youtube there is no reason to create a special page just for songs.

See below how the page looks from **Site Owner's** view:

<details><summary>DESKTOP ADMIN VIDEOS (ðŸ”»click to view ðŸ”»)</summary>

<br>

### Add Song

To add a song just click on **Add Song** button in the **VIDEOS** page.  
The form will present four options: **Song Name**, **Album**, **New Song?**(Bolean) & **Video URL**.  
- If you tick the box with '**New Song?**' the link will render on both **VIDEOS** tab and **HOME PAGE - SONGS SECTION**.
- Older songs can still be found in Videos section along with New ones, but New ones are also showing in Home Page.  
The whole purpose is to attract people to check our new songs first and be up to date with our releases!
- You will also see a Toast notification on the top right corner that will state the name of the song you added.

<details><summary>DESKTOP ADD SONG (ðŸ”»click to view ðŸ”»)</summary>

## CART
![CART](./README_Images/Page%20Images/cart/desktop_cart_info.png)

- Cart has a list of items on the left-hand side and on the rifht it has quantity inputs along with Product description, Subtotal, Price and **Update** and **Delete** options. Delete will remove the item from the cart while Update will update the quantity of the current item we are dealing with depeneding on the qty we set.
- The threshold to reach free shipping is: **100 $**
- I have also added current current shipping value along with double strikethrough rule.  
I wanted to display it like that as it looks better when user can see how much is being saved on shipping alone.  
That might incite them to spend a few bit extra.

- Under **Grand Total** we have two buttons. 'Keep Shopping' is to go back to the store while **Secure Checkout** will finalize the cart and move to checkout stage.

- In the Mobile Cart we have our entire Cart displayed vertically only where items are lined up and **checkout** buttons are on the top.

Check detailed view to see how an Empty Cart and Mobile Cart look:

- In the Checkout Page, we have a submit form for customer/member to put in their details.  
If the user is logged in, majority of the fields will populate.  
If the user is **GUEST**, user will be offered to create an account or essentially log in if member.
<br>

- We can also enter checkout page directly from **Toast Notification**.
    ![#](./README_Images/Page%20Images/checkout/toast_checkout.png)

    Depending on the amount, we could avail of Free Shipping in which case **Delivery** notification will turn to **FREE**.

### Order Confirmation
![ORDER CONFIRMATION](./README_Images/Page%20Images/checkout/order_confirmation.png)

# SOCIAL MEDIA AND MARKETING

For Social Media Marketing, Facebook is still the best option to promote bands and share all the relevant information regarding Merchandise offers, Tours, Song releases, etc  

It's the best way to reach out to younger fans which is the main target audience for Renegade Band.  
In Facebook, 22% of users are aged between 18 - 24 and 31% are aged between 25 - 34 years of age which puts this into better perspective.

<br>

## Renegade Band Facebook Page
![Renegade Band Facebook Page](./README_Images/Digital%20Marketing/facebook.png)
- The link to our Facebook page can be found [here.](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100086604560986&viewas=&show_switched_toast=false&show_switched_tooltip=false&is_tour_dismissed=false&is_tour_completed=false&show_podcast_settings=false&show_community_transition=false&show_community_review_changes=false&should_open_composer=false&badge_type=NEW_MEMBER&show_community_rollback_toast=false&show_community_rollback=false&show_follower_visibility_disclosure=false&bypass_exit_warning=true)

- As you can see our Facebook Page has a nicely built **Intro** with band description & location.  
Single post has been made as a template of how we would use Facebook to reach out audience and share the information regarding the new release of the album and upcoming Tour.

<br>

## Newsletter

- We have already covered newsletter in [Home - Newsletter](#home---newsletter) section.
The form is fully functional and will send a welcome email to the user.  
The newsletter section has been created via 'EmailJS' and the rest was custom code found on various sides of **YouTube**.

<br>

## Privacy Policy

I used [Privacy Policy Generator](https://www.privacypolicygenerator.info/) to generate a [report](https://www.privacypolicygenerator.info/live.php?token=jqTvmFQltqNqxKeXyGhsspij2kentRAi) and ensure that the website is compliant with the European Privacy Policy Rules.

# SEARCH ENGINE OPTIMIZATION

Site was optimized by careful selection of keywords relating to the **renegade band**, **metal music** and **band merch**.
Keywords were chosen based on common topics in the Music and Merchandise. The keywords were tested in Google Search and all of them returned relevant information about metal band merchandise, tickets, events and so on.

Below is the screenshot of our **head.html** SEO including **keywords**.

![#](./README_Images/SEO/keywords.png)

<br>

## sitemap.xml

- A sitemap file with a list of important URLs was added to ensure that search engines are able to easily navigate through the site and understand its structure.  
This was made using XML-sitemaps.com by following the next steps:

    - Paste the URL of the deployed site into XML-sitemaps
    - Download the XML sitemap file
    - Add the file into the projects root folder, named as sitemap.xml

<br>

## robots.txt

A robots.txt file was created to tell the search engines where not to go on our website and increase the quality of the site, improving the SEO rating.

# AWS SETUP

<br>

## AWS S3 Bucket 

The deployed site uses AWS S3 Buckets to store the webpages static and media files. More information on how you can set up an AWS S3 Bucket can be found below:

1. Create an AWS account [here](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/).
2. Login to your account and within the search bar type in **S3**.
3. Within the S3 page click on the button that says **Create Bucket**.
4. Name the bucket and select the region which is closest to you.
5. Underneath **Object Ownership** select **ACLs enabled**.
6. Uncheck "Block Public Access" and acknowledge that the bucket will be made public, then click **Create Bucket**.
7. Inside the created bucket click on the **Properties** tab. Below "Static Website Hosting" click **Edit** and change the Static website hosting option to **Enabled**. Copy the default values for the index and error documents and click **Save Changes**.
8. Click on the **Permissions** tab, below **Cross-origin Resource Sharing (CORS)**, click **Edit** and then paste in the following code:

  ```
    [
        {
            "AllowedHeaders": [
            "Authorization"
            ],
            "AllowedMethods": [
            "GET"
            ],
            "AllowedOrigins": [
            "*"
            ],
            "ExposeHeaders": []
        }
    ]
  ```

9. Within the **Bucket Policy** section. Click **Edit** and then **Policy Generator**. Click the **Select Type of Policy** dropdown and select **S3 Bucket Policy** and within **Principle** allow all principals by typing "*".
10. Within the "Actions" dropdown menu select **Get Object** and in the previous tab copy the **Bucket ARN number**. Paste this within the policy generator within the field labelled **Amazon Resource Name (ARN)**.
11. Click **Add statement > Generate Policy** and copy the policy that's been generated and paste this into the **Bucket Policy Editor**.
12. Before saving, add /* at the end of your **Resource Key**, this will allow access to all resources within the bucket.
13. Once saved, scroll down to the **Access Control List (ACL)** and click **Edit**.
14. Next to **Everyone (public access)**, check the **list** checkbox and save your changes.

### IAM Set Up

1. Search for IAM within the AWS navigation bar and select it.
2. Click **User Groups** that can be seen in the side bar and then click **Create group** and name the group 'manage-your-project-name'.
3. Click "Policies" and then **Create policy**.
4. Navigate to the JSON tab and click **Import Managed Policy**, within here search **S3** and select **AmazonS3FullAccess** followed by **Import**.
5. Navigate back to the recently created S3 bucket and copy your **ARN Number**. Go back to **This Policy** and update the **Resource Key** to include your ARN Number, and another line with your ARN followed by a "/*".
   
- Below is an example of what this should look like:

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:*",

            ],
            "Resource": [
                "YOUR-ARN-NO-HERE",
                "YOUR-ARN-NO-HERE/*"

        }
    ]
**

```

1. Ensure the policy has been given a name and a short description, then click **Create Policy**.
2. Click "User groups", and then the group you created earlier. Under permissions click "Add Permission" and from the dropdown click **Attach Policies**.
3. Select **Users** from the sidebar and click **Add User**.

### Connecting AWS to the Project

1. Within your terminal install the following packages by typing 

```
  pip3 install boto3
  pip3 install django-storages 
```  

2. Freeze the requirements by typing:

```
pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
```

3. Add "storages" to your installed apps within your settings.py file.
4. At the bottom of the settings.py file add the following code:

```
if 'USE_AWS' in os.environ:
    AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME = 'insert-bucket-name-here'
    AWS_S3_REGION_NAME = 'insert-your-region-here'
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = os.environ.get('AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID')
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = os.environ.get('AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY')
```
5. Add the following keys within Heroku: **AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID** and **AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY**. These can be found in your CSV file.
6. Add the key **USE_AWS**, and set the value to True within Heroku.
6. Remove the **DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC** variable from Heroku.
7. Within your **settings.py** file inside the code just written add:

# STRIPE PAYMENTS

- The Stripe payments system is set up as the online payment processing and credit card processing platform for the purchases. 
You will need a stripe account which you can sign up for [here](https://stripe.com/en-ie).


### Payments 
- To set up stripe payments please follow the guide [here](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/accept-a-payment#web-collect-card-details).

### Webhooks

1. To set up a webhook, sign into your stripe account and click **Developers** located in the top right of the navbar.
2. Then in the side-nav under the Developers title, click on "Webhooks", then **Add endpoint**.
3. On the next page you will need to input the link to your heroku app followed by /checkout/wh/.
    - I shared STRIPE Webhooks screenshots earlier during checkout. Find more here: [Stripe](#stripe).

4. Then click on **+ Select events** and check **Select all events** checkbox at the top before clicking **Add events** at the bottom. Once this is done finish the form by clicking **Add endpoint**.
5. Your webhook is now created and you should see that it has generated a secret key. This key is required for Heroku config Vars.
6. Head over to your app in heroku and navigate to the config vars section under settings. You will need the secret key you just generated for your webhook, in addition to your Publishable key and secret key that you can find in the API keys section back in stripe.
7. Add these values under these keys:
   
    ```
    STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY = 'insert your stripe publishable key'
    STRIPE_SECRET_KEY = 'insert your secret key'
    STRIPE_WH_SECRET = 'insert your webhooks secret key'

    ```
8. In the end back in your **settings.py** file, insert the following code at the bottom of the file: 

    ```
    STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY = os.getenv('STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY', '')
    STRIPE_SECRET_KEY = os.getenv('STRIPE_SECRET_KEY', '')
    STRIPE_WH_SECRET = os.getenv('STRIPE_WH_SECRET', '')
    ```

### Code

- Followed Boutique Ado from CodeInstitute LMS for assistance my PP5. I changed some things throughout the project but checkout and stripe core functionality is borrowed from B.A.  
Store and Cart were changed a bit but functionality follows the same that was covered in B.A.

- Website styling is mostly mine but I used [AlterBridge](https://alterbridge.com/) website as an inspiration for styling.

- [Build an Ecommerce Website with Django](https://www.youtube.com/c/JustDjango) Youtube channel was a great help and a starting point.

- I also used [Dennis Ivy's Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/DennisIvy) for tips on Django Ecommerce and it was a great starting point, especially to practice.
