# WELCOME TO RENEGADE BAND PAGE 


[View the live project here.](https://renegade-band.herokuapp.com/)


This project was built for Code Institute's Portfolio 5 Assessment.  
It was built via Full-stack development program through Django Framework.  
More on Technologies used can be found below.

Site is a fictitious e-commerce band page for American Metal Band called **Renegade**.  
It allows users to access band's **merch** & **tour events** but also offers information on band members, about section and band songs, especially **new songs** *(singles)* which can be found on home page.

Project Idea came from my own interest to build a site a friend who actively plays in a band. It is a good opportunity to showcase the skills learned over the course.

### Agile Approach
Site functionality and development all through this project was managed using GitHub Projects which can be found here [Renegade Band User Stories](https://github.com/users/anluke/projects/4).

<br>

### The Scope

#### Main Site Goals

- To provide users with a good website experience with Band Merch & Tour Events.
- To provide users with a visually pleasing website that is intuitive and easy to navigate.
- To provide a website with a clear purpose.
- To provide tools that allow users to search for products.
- To provide users with an easy and safe way to buy their products.
- To provide users with breadcrumbs menu so they can more easily navigate through the site.

<br>

#### Colours

![Colours](./README_Images/Colors/Colors%20charts.png)<br>

- Color Scheme is simple but still modern. As I'm a fan of **"Dark Mode on everything"**, I decided to go with Black background with white text. Hero Image touches on **Orange** and **Yellow** color with darker tones. **Cancel** button is in **warning-red** color while **Tour** buttons are all blue. Most of the continuity buttons are colored in **warning-color** as that gives a clear distinction of a button navigation to next step. Warning/Danger colors have nothing to with names, I just used them directly from bootstrap as they represented the best option for me.  
Checkout button inside the **toast** checkout popup is also labeled light blue.  
**EDIT** button is left white, **DELETE** is red and ***Update** is light blue.  
Black color was used for both header and footer with white text.




#### Typography

- Roboto font is used as the main font for the whole project.

#### Imagery

- Most of the images are **.PNG** and **.JPEG** format.  
Future improvement could be made by transforming them all into **.WEBP** file to improve the site performance but due to the length of this project I realised that a bit too late and left it as a future minor improvement.

***For Current Band Members Lineup I Have Selected Dearly Departed Musicians From Metal Community.***

<br>

<br>


## VIDEOS

![VIDEOS](./README_Images/Page%20Images/videos/desktop_videos.png)
- Video section has all of the bands official video songs or songs that have a video format.  
- Links are hosted via **YouTube** and imported to page directly by using **EMBED** link in the **URL** of the form.  
An example of a suck URL is: ***https://www.youtube.com/embed/0zMMAQVWeag***  
that ```/embed/``` in between **YT** page and **ID** of the song is very important for proper rendering.  
- If you do not put embed into the link, DJANGO will render the whole YouTube page you are seeing, including the music video.  
I have found this way to be best to utilize what I want and have also put a warning in the form.

<br>
<br>

***For Videos I have used Alter Bridge video songs as links.***  
***Needless to say, not just because I'm the fan but because I took inspiration from their website.***  

<br>

With videos you can only **EDIT** or **DELETE**.  
Since music is being played directly from youtube there is no reason to create a special page just for songs.

See below how the page looks from **Site Owner's** view:

<details><summary>DESKTOP ADMIN VIDEOS (ðŸ”»click to view ðŸ”»)</summary>

</details>

<br>

### Add Song

To add a song just click on **Add Song** button in the **VIDEOS** page.  
The form will present four options: **Song Name**, **Album**, **New Song?**(Bolean) & **Video URL**.  
- If you tick the box with '**New Song?**' the link will render on both **VIDEOS** tab and **HOME PAGE - SONGS SECTION**.
- Older songs can still be found in Videos section along with New ones, but New ones are also showing in Home Page.  
The whole purpose is to attract people to check our new songs first and be up to date with our releases!
- You will also see a Toast notification on the top right corner that will state the name of the song you added.

<details><summary>DESKTOP ADD SONG (ðŸ”»click to view ðŸ”»)</summary>

## CART
![CART](./README_Images/Page%20Images/cart/desktop_cart_info.png)

- Cart has a list of items on the left-hand side and on the rifht it has quantity inputs along with Product description, Subtotal, Price and **Update** and **Delete** options. Delete will remove the item from the cart while Update will update the quantity of the current item we are dealing with depeneding on the qty we set.
- The threshold to reach free shipping is: **100 $**
- I have also added current current shipping value along with double strikethrough rule.  
I wanted to display it like that as it looks better when user can see how much is being saved on shipping alone.  
That might incite them to spend a few bit extra.

- Under **Grand Total** we have two buttons. 'Keep Shopping' is to go back to the store while **Secure Checkout** will finalize the cart and move to checkout stage.

- In the Mobile Cart we have our entire Cart displayed vertically only where items are lined up and **checkout** buttons are on the top.

Check detailed view to see how an Empty Cart and Mobile Cart look:

## CHECKOUT
![CHECKOUT](./README_Images/Page%20Images/checkout/desktop_checkout.png)

- In the Checkout Page, we have a submit form for customer/member to put in their details.  
If the user is logged in, majority of the fields will populate.  
If the user is **GUEST**, user will be offered to create an account or essentially log in if member.
<br>

- We can also enter checkout page directly from **Toast Notification**.
    ![#](./README_Images/Page%20Images/checkout/toast_checkout.png)

    Depending on the amount, we could avail of Free Shipping in which case **Delivery** notification will turn to **FREE**.

# SOCIAL MEDIA AND MARKETING

For Social Media Marketing, Facebook is still the best option to promote bands and share all the relevant information regarding Merchandise offers, Tours, Song releases, etc  

It's the best way to reach out to younger fans which is the main target audience for Renegade Band.  
In Facebook, 22% of users are aged between 18 - 24 and 31% are aged between 25 - 34 years of age which puts this into better perspective.

<br>

## Renegade Band Facebook Page
![Renegade Band Facebook Page](./README_Images/Digital%20Marketing/facebook.png)
- The link to our Facebook page can be found [here.](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100086604560986&viewas=&show_switched_toast=false&show_switched_tooltip=false&is_tour_dismissed=false&is_tour_completed=false&show_podcast_settings=false&show_community_transition=false&show_community_review_changes=false&should_open_composer=false&badge_type=NEW_MEMBER&show_community_rollback_toast=false&show_community_rollback=false&show_follower_visibility_disclosure=false&bypass_exit_warning=true)

- As you can see our Facebook Page has a nicely built **Intro** with band description & location.  
Single post has been made as a template of how we would use Facebook to reach out audience and share the information regarding the new release of the album and upcoming Tour.

<br>

## Newsletter

- We have already covered newsletter in [Home - Newsletter](#home---newsletter) section.
The form is fully functional and will send a welcome email to the user.  
The newsletter section has been created via 'EmailJS' and the rest was custom code found on various sides of **YouTube**.

<br>

## Privacy Policy

    - Paste the URL of the deployed site into XML-sitemaps
    - Download the XML sitemap file
    - Add the file into the projects root folder, named as sitemap.xml
