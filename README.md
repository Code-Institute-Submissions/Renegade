# WELCOME TO RENEGADE BAND PAGE 


[View the live project here.](https://renegade-band.herokuapp.com/)


This project was built for Code Institute's Portfolio 5 Assessment.  
It was built via Full-stack development program through Django Framework.  
More on Technologies used can be found below.

Site is a fictitious e-commerce band page for American Metal Band called **Renegade**.  
It allows users to access band's **merch** & **tour events** but also offers information on band members, about section and band songs, especially **new songs** *(singles)* which can be found on home page.

Project Idea came from my own interest to build a site a friend who actively plays in a band. It is a good opportunity to showcase the skills learned over the course.

-  ### Agile Approach
    Site functionality and development all through this project was managed using GitHub Projects which can be found here [Renegade Band User Stories](https://github.com/users/anluke/projects/4).


-  ### The Scope

    -   #### Main Site Goals

        - To provide users with a good website experience with Band Merch & Tour Events.
        - To provide users with a visually pleasing website that is intuitive and easy to navigate.
        - To provide a website with a clear purpose.
        - To provide tools that allow users to search for products.
        - To provide users with an easy and safe way to buy their products.

-   #### Colours

![Colours](./README_Images/Colors/Colors%20charts.png)<br>

- Color Scheme is simple but still modern. As I'm a fan of **"Dark Mode on everything"**, I decided to go with Black background with white text. Hero Image touches on **Orange** and **Yellow** color with darker tones. **Cancel** button is in **warning-red** color while **Tour** buttons are all blue. Most of the continuity buttons are colored in **warning-color** as that gives a clear distinction of a button navigation to next step. Warning/Danger colors have nothing to with names, I just used them directly from bootstrap as they represented the best option for me.  
Checkout button inside the **toast** checkout popup is also labeled light blue.  
**EDIT** button is left white, **DELETE** is red and ***Update** is light blue.  
Black color was used for both header and footer with white text.




#### Typography

- Roboto font is used as the main font for the whole project.

#### Imagery

- Most of the images are **.PNG** and **.JPEG** format.  
Future improvement could be made by transforming them all into **.WEBP** file to improve the site performance but due to the length of this project I realised that a bit too late and left it as a future minor improvement.

-   ## Data Model

    ![Data Model](./README_Images/Data%20Model/Renegade%20Data%20Model.png)<br>



# Features













<!-- # Features -->



-   ### Responsivity

The application is responsive on all device sizes, thanks to the [Bootstrapious](https://bootstrapious.com/) (bootstrap4)
 theme. In mobile view there is a collapsible menu icon. All images, text labels, forms get appropriately resized.


-  #### Interactive elements
    * Nav links for Home, Menu, Blog, About, My bookings, Signup, Login and Logout link.
    * Form input fields on signup, logout, update and delete posts.
    * Buttons - including form buttons (signup, login, logout, table booking, edit and delete posts buttons and page navigation buttons (when there is too many blog posts)

-   ### Features to add in future   
    -   #### I would like to add a notification pop up that shows up on screen when user logs in/logs out.
    -   #### I would like to add a possibility of deleting comments but only if you are an owner.
    -   #### I would like to add more options to the Sign In form and have Registration only be active once the user has verified their account through email address.

Blog is the site where you can see all the blog posts, and make use of the Navigation bar to switch between slides if there's more then 3-4 blogs posted.

It has a category section that displays all the current 'Active' categories that the users selected and also latest posts on the top.

It also features the number of views by users that are logged in along with the number of comments aside.

This shows that admin created the first post and can delete that one but he can't delete or update Jonathan's post.

An Admin account is just used a normal user and if it would be necessary to delete that post it can be done through Admin portal. Deletion from the portal is something we can expand this project down the line.


## Sign up Section

![Sign Up](https://github.com/anluke/guitar-portal/blob/main/README-IMAGES/LINKS/signup.png?raw=true)

We have our three input forms for signing in. User needs to follow the guide provided under the input forms in order to successfully create an account. After he creates an account it automatically logs him in.


## Log in Section

Similar to our Sign up form. It only has two input forms. Password and Username.

# Testing

Testing was constistent throughout the deployment especially with Python.

The W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator Services were used to validate every pagefor HTML and CSS of the project. The issue is that this project is using a template and if loaded directly via link from Heroku or via GitPod link it will throw many errors as can be seen below:

-   [W3C URI Validator](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_uri)    
    - <details><summary>HTML TEST</summary>
        <img src="https://github.com/anluke/guitar-portal/blob/main/README-IMAGES/TESTING-IMG/HTML-TEST-IMG/html.png?raw=true">
    </details>  

    HTML Summary tested without any Errors. There is a warning for my gallery. It is asking for heading elements but that whole section is filled with my pictures so I decided to leave it like that as it is not affecting functionality of my site and the TEST passed.  
<br>
    
-   [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input)
    - <details><summary>CSS TEST</summary>
        <img src="https://github.com/anluke/guitar-portal/blob/main/README-IMAGES/TESTING-IMG/CSS-TEST-IMG/css.png?raw=true">
    </details>  
    CSS Summary tested without any errors. CSS did give warnings and when I looked into it they are just webkit tools. They are related to Google Fonts and vendor extension prefixes which will not affect the CSS performance. A lot of them have also been imported through Bootstrapious.

    The only warnings Python gave was 'line-too-long' which I tried to fix in 'settings.py' file and other files and it did not look right and in some cases was breaking the page. I have decided to leave them in as they are not major issues:

- ### Lighthouse  
  
  Lighthouse was used to test Performance, Best Practices, Accessibility and SEO on Desktop. Snippet bellow:

    Due to outdated jQuery version and other files that came with 'Bootstrapious' there are slight discrepancies, but it's functional and the test passed.

    As I didn't write much JS, I can only post emailJS that I added to submit a newsletter request. Snippet below:
    The guide was followed by Code Institite's lesson on Email JS.

- ### Manual Testing

    * The Signup, Login and Logout all working correctly.

    * All the internal links are working and bring the user to the right page on the website.

    * All the external links are working and bring the user to the right social media page by 
    opening a new browser tab.
    
    * The Categories Page shows the genres and guitar brands. It picks up new categories from created posts.

    * The newsletter submit form takes the email and sends the newsletter welcome email to the user. The don't have to be logged in to use that service.

    * The pagination system is working. It adds another page after 3 posts or so.

    * The comment form has no issues and it submits a new comment once the form is completed by a
        registered user. 

    * CRUD is working. User is able to create, read, update and and delete their own posts. Superuser is able to delete posts in the backend 'admin' area regardless of the level.

    * When switching between accounts, the 'views' icon is incrementing as it should be.

    * When comment is posted it also incremenets an icon on the latest page section and the actual blog post.

    Tested this feature few days ago just after successfully uploading to Heroku. I was told by one of the Tutors that it is most likely and issue between Heroku and Cloudinary Everything else seems to work so this is only error which does not seem to be affecting my site's functionality.


## Deployment

The site was deployed via Heroku.
1.  Log in to Heroku or create an account if required.
2.  Then, click the button labelled New from the dashboard in the top right corner and from the drop-down menu select Create New App.  You must enter a unique app name
3.  Next, select your region.
4.  Click on the Create App button.
5.  In your app go to Resources tab and add a Heroku Postgres database.
6.  The next page you will see is the projectâ€™s **Deploy Tab**. Click on the Settings Tab and scroll down to **Config Vars** and enter:
    *   **CLOUDINARY_URL** = your cloudinary key
    *   **DATABASE_URL** = the url of your heroku postgres database
    *   **SECRET_KEY** = a secret key for your app.
    *   **PORT = 8000**
    *   **DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC = 1** during development and remove when deploying to production

7.  Scroll to the top of the page and now choose the Deploy tab.
8.  Select Github as the deployment method.
9.  Confirm you want to connect to GitHub.
10. Search for the repository name and click the connect button.
11. Scroll to the bottom of the deploy page and select preferred deployment type:
12. Click either Enable Automatic Deploys for automatic deployment when you push updates to Github.
13. Select the correct branch for deployment from the drop-down menu and click **Deploy Branch** for manual deployment.

NB: Ensure in Django settings, **DEBUG is False**, create a **Procfile** and save database and cloudinary urls and secret key to **env.py.**

## Special Thanks:

- To all the Tutors, especially Scott and Ger. They helped me out when I was badly stuck.
- Also want to thank my Mentor for his support and guidance and the material he sent that helped me get the better idea for this project.


## Plans for implementation

- Project was hard. I wanted to do so much more but I couldn't risk it as I was quite late to start with already.  
There is definitely room for improvement but I wanted to get at least a working MVP with CRUD implementation that looks nice and can be implemented down the line.
- I have learned a lot during this PP4.
